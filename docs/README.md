# UnturnedDocs

> Welcome to the Unofficial Documentation for Unturned 3's Code!

## Getting Started

Most classes have their own page dedicated on the sidebar, if you're looking for a specific thing, just hop right over there!

Not sure what you're doing? 

It's ok, we've all been there. Check out the [Creating a Module](guides/creating_a_module) guide for information on how to get started developing for Unturned.
