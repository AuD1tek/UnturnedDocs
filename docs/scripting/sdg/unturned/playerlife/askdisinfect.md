Adds some of the infecton stat to the player.

This disinfects the player as the infection stat goes opposite the other major stats.

If you want to decrease the infection stat, use [askInfect(byte)](scripting/sdg/unturned/playerlife/askinfect).

```csharp
public void askDisinfect(byte amount);
```
