Breaks the player's legs.

If you want to damage the health stat, use [askDamage(byte, Vector3, EDeathCause, ELimb, CSteamID, out EPlayerKill)](scripting/sdg/unturned/playerlife/askheal).

If you want to heal the health stat or fix the broken legs, use [askHeal(byte, bool, bool)](scripting/sdg/unturned/playerlife/askheal)

```csharp
public void breakLegs();
```
